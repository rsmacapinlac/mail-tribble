# mail-tribble

Why mail-tribble? Why not? I really just used the Github project naming algorithm.

The goals of this project:
- Centralize my email rules and make it provider agnostic
- Containerize it, so I can run it in my homelab
- Make it work with my dotfiles


What is this project using?

- [imapfilter](https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter)
- [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)

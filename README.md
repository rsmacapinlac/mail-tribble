# mail-tribble

Why the name mail-tribble? Why not? I really just used the Github project naming algorithm.

The goals is to have my home-lab

The goals of this project:
- Centralize my email rules and make it provider agnostic
- Containerize it, so I can run it in my homelab
- Make it work with my dotfiles

The goal is to self-host my email-filter rules.
- Store the email filters using dotfiles that contain the imapfilter
- Use [ofelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia) to handle the scheduling

How I configure my dotfiles?

What is this project using?

- [ofelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia)
- [imapfilter](https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter)
- [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)
